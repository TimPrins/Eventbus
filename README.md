## Synopsis

A simple eventbus made at my internship to learn the basics of classes in Js and to learn how to export and import a file.

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## How to use the eventbus 
```
node eventbus.js
```
